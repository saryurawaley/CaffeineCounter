# CaffeineCounter
## Inspiration
As highschoolers we can already witness the beginning of caffeine addictions, and we can infer that these will only progress as we enter post-secondary. To proactively combat this we wanted to create a caffeine tracker that took scheduling into consideration to better help students plan their caffeine intake.

## What it does
Front-end:
The user can begin using our front end by completing a form filled with personal information, this helps our application determine an estimated tolerance level and their recommended caffeine intake level. The front-end allows students and individuals to enter drinks that they consume and based on drink type and size we can determine the average amount of caffeine the drink must’ve had. These stats are then sent to the daily tracker chart with all the caffeinated drinks they have had and shares stats about their intake. It also has maps tool to help locate nearby caffeine suppliers such as local coffee shops. It also has a scheduling feature where students can enter their schedules and the app will determine the optimal time for users to drink coffee and use it to focus.

Back-end: 
Our back-end component uses the user’s given personal information to determine an estimated caffeine tolerance level. They can then enter the drink they just consumed and based on drink type and size we can determine the average amount of caffeine the drink must’ve had. From there we can compare the amount of caffeine in the drink to the user’s tolerance level to see if they are below or over their recommended caffeine intake level. Our back-end program will then inform the user if they are within their tolerance level or not. 

## How we built it
We built the front end completely with Figma and we decided to create a small example of how the tracker would function in the backend through Java and utilizing replit.

## Challenges we ran into
A major challenge we ran into was the recent power outage that occurred in Toronto. One teammate had lost electricity for 16 hours and had to work offline, occasionally checking in with the team on hotspots. 

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
The front end took quite a while to do because we were both unfamiliar with Figma and we only tried it out once before. We were very happy with the different components we created and the presentation of the app.

## What we learned
As we mentioned we were still very new to Figma and were able to learn about creating components and frames through various Youtube Videos.

## What's next for Caffeine Counter
We plan on adding a feature that tracks the user’s spending on caffeine as regularly buying drinks can be costly. This will allow users to manage their funds and not overspend.
